RoboHydra server
================

RoboHydra is a testing tool for HTTP-based clients (ie. any software
that talks to other software using HTTP). You connect your clients to
it and it responds with whatever you need for each request.  It can be
used for Javascript-heavy web application front-ends, clients of
HTTP-based APIs (eg. the Flickr API), etc. It helps answer questions
like "how would the client behave when it receives a certain response
from the server?", "does the client send the correct request to the
server when certain action is performed?", "what would happen if this
request takes more than normal to process", or "what would happen if
this request gets its response before this other request?".

A RoboHydra is composed of "heads", pieces of code that listen in a
given path and trigger a certain behaviour when a request for that
path is received. The behaviour can be checking the incoming request,
returning a static response, serving a file from the file system,
proxy the request to another server, store certain data and return
with a canned response, etc. All these different behaviours can be
combined in powerful ways to achieve the results you need.
