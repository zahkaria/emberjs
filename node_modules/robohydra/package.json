  "readme": "RoboHydra server\n================\n\nRoboHydra is a testing tool for HTTP-based clients (ie. any software\nthat talks to other software using HTTP). You connect your clients to\nit and it responds with whatever you need for each request.  It can be\nused for Javascript-heavy web application front-ends, clients of\nHTTP-based APIs (eg. the Flickr API), etc. It helps answer questions\nlike \"how would the client behave when it receives a certain response\nfrom the server?\", \"does the client send the correct request to the\nserver when certain action is performed?\", \"what would happen if this\nrequest takes more than normal to process\", or \"what would happen if\nthis request gets its response before this other request?\".\n\nA RoboHydra is composed of \"heads\", pieces of code that listen in a\ngiven path and trigger a certain behaviour when a request for that\npath is received. The behaviour can be checking the incoming request,\nreturning a static response, serving a file from the file system,\nproxy the request to another server, store certain data and return\nwith a canned response, etc. All these different behaviours can be\ncombined in powerful ways to achieve the results you need.\n\nRoboHydra is written in Javascript, runs under Node and is distributed\nunder the Apache 2.0 license.
